Simulation for generating realistic distance matrices

AG_unifrac.r:
Sample code for reading in American Gut data and estimating a Unifrac distance


sim_benchmark.r:
Simulate a Unifrac Distance matrix based on benchmark distance matrix from American Gut data with a scaling parameter sigma that adjust effects sizes


sim_Kelly.r:
Simulate a Unifrac Distance matrix with pre-specified within-group distance level and effect sizes using techniques from Kelly (2015).


permanova.r:
Estimate PERMANOVA power of a distance matrix using bootstrap sampling.
